HyChecker is a Python script that allows you to check avaiable usernames for the game Hytale by Hypixel Studios.

Dependencies:
1. VSCode/Python
2. Python's requests module

How To Use:
1. Place hychecker.py & name.txt in a folder
2. Modify name.txt by entering the names you're after (examples are given within the file itself)
3. Run hychecker.py

If ran correctly, the files: available_names.txt, unavailable_names.txt and name_checked.txt should appear

Optional:
1. Run refresh.py to see if the names you're after are still available

If ran correctly, the list of names that are still available will remain in available_names.txt, otherwise moved to unavailable_names.txt
